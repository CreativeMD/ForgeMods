# ForgeMods

Repository for all the mods.

## Setup

Navigate to `/MixinGradle`, open a command prompt and run the following commands

```
gradlew build
gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Go back to the root directory and use it like any other mod repository. Feel free to exclude mods in `settings.gradle`.

## Fabric

A similar setup exists for Fabric:
